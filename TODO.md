## Sure
- Minus tests
- Asterisk tests
- Time flag
- :parsefn in args
- lang/core tests
- Nested blocks
- Multiple files
 - Feed output to other file's input
- Clojure interop
- Make a difference between " and '
- Random tests which check with the real Ruby implementation
- Read from stdin instead of [] default in main-
- Get rid of declares
- Check for more expected errors in tests
- print/inspect-table for inspection
- Parallel alternatives
- Gpush and such

## Project
- Generate documentation
- Better project.clj
- Leiningen 2
- Upload to JAR repo
- Re-read GolfScript site for quirks and review builtins

## Maybe
- Make blocks lazy but realizable
- Use `reduce` instead of `recur` for `golfure.interpreter/execute-block`
- Go back to thread-wise `*symbols*` or atom
- Web interface
- API interface
